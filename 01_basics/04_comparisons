console.log(2>=1);//true
console.log(2<1);
console.log(2==1);
// will always consistent answer as both side same type are being checked
//in other examples type may get convert into different type creating inconsistency in desired output 

console.log("2" > 1);
console.log("02" >1);


console.log(null >0);
console.log(null==0);
console.log(null >=0);
// equality check == and comparisons >,<,>=,<=
//work different
//comparisons convert null to a number, treating it as 0.
//this is the reason why 3rd output i.e>=0 is true 

console.log(undefined == 0);
console.log(undefined >0);
console.log(undefined < 0);
//better to avoid this type as might create inconsistency in code


//===   =>also checks data type along with value checking

console.log("2"===2);
