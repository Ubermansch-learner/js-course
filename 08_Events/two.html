<!-- async events discussion -->

<!--

javascipt is a synchronous and single threaded lang by default.
execution context = execute one line of code at a time
each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing bcz single threaded.
Blocking code                      vs                                non blocking code
\block the flow of program                                         /do not block execution
\read file sync                                                    /read file async and execute code 

Till user registers data correctly and DB gets updated then only show registered successfully message= sync
if it is showing register successfully without first storing and updating in DB , there may be errors like chances of wrong details input by user so here async is not a correct usecase
